# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** for ADRs that touch the area being worked on, if that directory exists.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept needed isn't in the glossary yet, either reconsider whether the term belongs to this project or note the gap for `grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because..._
